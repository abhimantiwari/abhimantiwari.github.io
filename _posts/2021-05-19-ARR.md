When you use [ARR](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing) (Application Request Routing) as reverse proxy/ front end to your application server, as you know, requests to your application goes to the ARR server first. And (as usual) if the client (i.e., browser) to ARR communication is happening over HTTPS, after performing the SSL handshake on your application’s behalf, ARR forwards the client requests to the backend server which is running your application code. 



ARR attaches a special request header `X-ARR-SSL` to every request coming over HTTPS. And it contains information about SSL server certificate which was used to secure TCP communication between client (i.e., browser) and ARR server. 


The backend http.sys detects the value of the `X-ARR-SSL` header, and it terminates the connection with http status code 400, when it finds any Non-HTTP.SYS/RFC complaint value in it.
<br/>
As in the example shown below, we have `O=HS` unknown character in the certificate properly.
> Note – `O=HS` // it’s the Norwegian `«Ø»` character.

```ruby
- Http: Request, GET /test.htm
    Command: GET
  + URI: /test.htm
    ProtocolVersion: HTTP/1.1
    Connection:  Keep-Alive
    Accept:  text/html, application/xhtml+xml, image/jxr, */*
    Accept-Encoding:  gzip, deflate
    Accept-Language:  en-US
    Host:  abc.xyz.com
    Max-Forwards:  10
    UserAgent:  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Touch; rv:11.0) like Gecko
    dnt:  1
    X-Original-URL:  /testsite/test.htm
    X-Forwarded-For:  [fe80::xxx:3489:d647:454b%6]:63354
    X-ARR-SSL:  2048|256|DC=no, DC=hfdrift, DC=iam, CN=SD3-CA-IAM-01|C=NO, L=Drammen, O=HS, OU=STHF, CN=abc.xyz.com
    X-ARR-LOG-ID:  83df8fbe-d6f9-4651-9d02-4f2888ef83d8
    HeaderEnd: CRLF
```
<br/>
Notice that any unknown character e.g., one shown above, would be ideally pulled from the Certificate properties itself. The backend HTTP.SYS instantly rejected the request with status code- 400, when it find any such character, as shown below – 

```ruby
- Http: Response, HTTP/1.1, Status: Bad request, URL: /test.htm
    ProtocolVersion: HTTP/1.1
    StatusCode: 400, Bad request
    Reason: Bad Request
  + ContentType:  text/html; charset=us-ascii
    Server:  Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
    Date:  Thu, 08 May 2021 07:47:40 GMT
    Connection:  close
    ContentLength:  311
    HeaderEnd: CRLF
  + payload: HttpContentType =  text/html; charset=us-ascii
```
<br/>
**Suggestion**: Verify the certificate which you are using, and check the properly if there is any unknown character. If so, work with the certificate provider to fix the same.

<br/>
> PS – You can also use this value (“X-ARR-SSL”) to detect if the call to your application was made over HTTP or HTTPS.
