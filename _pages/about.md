Engineer with Microsoft, working on the ASP.NET team, and doing a lot of .NET debugging, profiling, reverse engineering, and web-application performance tuning.

I owe a lot to the community, and I'm trying to pay it forward by contributing a little bit back through any means possible. This blog is my humble way of giving back to society. You can find blogs on Web Apps technologies, Azure SQL/Data, Azure Bot Services, Diagnostics, and other related technologies on the portal.
More to come!

Some of the samples' source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abhimantiwari).
