Program Manager on the Azure SQL team at Microsoft. In my previous roles, I have worked as a Web Developer/ Tech-lead, developed several software applications/ products majorly in .NET and related technologies, and done a lot of .NET debugging, reverse engineering, and web application performance tuning.

I owe a lot to the community, and I'm trying to pay it forward by contributing a little bit back through any means possible. This blog is my humble way of giving back to society. You can find blogs here on Web Apps technologies, Azure SQL/ SQL Server, Azure Bot Services, Diagnostics, and other related technologies.
More to come!

Some of the samples' source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abhimantiwari).
