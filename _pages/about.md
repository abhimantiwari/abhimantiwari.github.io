Program Manager on the Azure SQL team at Microsoft. In my previous roles, I have worked as a Web developer/ tech-lead, developed several software applications/ products majorly in .NET and related technologies, and done a lot of .NET debugging, reverse engineering, and web application performance tuning.

Here, you will find articles on various topics such as Azure SQL/ SQL Server, Web app technologies, diagnostics, and other related technologies.

Stay tuned for more content in the future!

Some of the samples' source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abhimantiwari).
